# WISSEN

Wissen (Wise / German for Knowledge) - A localized copy of a
centralized documentation store.

Aims to be a glomming of documentation from various sources to allow
strong querying of the documentation sources with something powerful
like SQL.

Will provide various interfaces for pulling in documentation from
another source and displaying it in the system SQL.

Then, various output formats can be derived from querying a database,
vs complex parsing of archaic ad-hoc source files.

## Overview

### General
#### Abstract
The intent is to index a lot of docs.

#### Why do this?
I feel that having so many doc systems is superflous, to the point
that almost no developers spend adequate time on reading
documentation, and instead opt for short blog posts etc.
